## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

Many people have contacted me asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually **yes, with attribution**.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

### TL;DR

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [jainex.me](https://jainex.me). Thanks!

<p>But It not complet yetðŸ˜… you can contributed too PR welcomeðŸ˜€</p>
